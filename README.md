# Financial-Fraud-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Hybrid-Autoencoder-MLP
A deep learning–based fraud detection system for highly imbalanced financial data. The project combines a supervised MLP with an autoencoder trained on normal transactions to learn behavioral patterns and detect anomalies, using feature engineering and evaluation with AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
